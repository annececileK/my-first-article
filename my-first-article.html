                <p>As summer is ending September is coming in New York. With it, the vivid and still painful memory of 9/11 18 years ago. If the city commemorates every September the nearly 3,000 people who perished during the terrorist attacks, this morning on August 28 at the corner of Greenwich and Rector streets, a first ceremony happened.</p>

<p>Today is special to Ann van Hine. She is receiving the American Flag in honor of his husband Bruce a FDNY fireman who died during the attacks, throughout a family yet very official ceremony lead by the 9/11 Tribute Museum in New York City and the Hackensack University Medical Center Honor Guard (HUMC) and other veterans.</p>

<p>As she became a strong member of the museum since it opened on 2006 “Ann has been leading tours and touching visitors with her story since 2006, having inspired people on over 400 tours,” explains Kwaku Farrar, the outreach manager of the 9/11 Tribute Museum. This morning, Ann hopes for one thing : peace. “At some point, there will be no more need for women and men to sign up in the army” she says.</p>

<p>“Sergeant Maciel, hoist the colors.” As President of Hackensack University Medical center Robert C. Garrett ends his speech, offering the museum a $911,01 donation check, the ceremony takes a solemn turn. Veterans, Marines, and Air Force soldiers are here to pay tribute to 9/11 victims. The “Last Post” sounds on the street, muffled by the noise of the building constructions. What better way to show that life goes on. Sergeant First Class Francisco Maciel, Iraq veteran where he served in combat from 2004 to 2005 agrees :  “After 9/11, we had to rebuild everything. Not only the district, but our American soul, saying to the world ‘you know what ? You’re not gonna get us down’. And that’s what is beautiful about it.” </p>

<p>Since almost two decades now, volunteers of the museum are telling the story of the 9/11 attacks.  Why ? “That day, New York came together, America came together and we should never forget that. It’s when you forget that it happens again,” says Sergeant Maciel. </p>

<p>Keeping with the gratitude of the memorial service, the Senate has given its final approval last month to grant emergency workers that rushed into World Trade Center chaos on 9/11 health care and compensation for the rest of their lives reported the New York Times on July 23rd. Hand in hand to that, Lieutenant Coffield, from HUMC, who gave a speech during the service made a point. She said : “They were ordinary people, responding in an extraordinary way.”
